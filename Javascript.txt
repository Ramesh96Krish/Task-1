Task of Day 1

QN:1  
Difference B/w HTTP 1.1 Vs HTTP 2
HTTP is called Hypertext transport Protocol, and this is set of Transfer Protocols that are used by Browser to Server for Request/Response to a server, HTTP were optimised from Http to HTTPS today,
HTTP 1.1:
It is the most famous Http method used for almost many years i.e., 15 years and it transfers the request and gets a response only 
it sents all the request in one TCP but if one request fails to return response all the other request were stopped.
IT sent the Data in the form of Text messages
It compreses the data by itself and loads the whole response and its data

HTTP 2:
It removes most of the flaws of HTTP1.1
It sents multiple request in one TCP by using the Multiplexing technique,where you would get a response even though the head got failed or blocked
It sents the data in the form of Binary model
It uses the Priorisation technique to load the server at faster rate 
it compreses the data by HCPACK

QN:2
